          <p>I received your information and it seems you left before I could give you <u>full access</u> to your
            complete <b>Wealth Manifestation Horoscope</b></p>
          <p>Yes, you’re are this close to getting your <u>personal and complete reading</u> delivered straight to your
            inbox!</p>
          <p>I have your sign. It's <span id="signUser"></span>.</p>
          <p>I have your birth date and location <span id="noBorn">. It's <user class="userMonth"></user>, <user
                class="userDay"></user>, <user id="cityName"></user>.</span></p>
          <p><span id="noBornP">And this is <b>excellent news!</b></span></p>
          <p><u>Jupiter</u> is the <u>dominant planet</u> in your astrological Wealth Manifestation Chart and it’s for
            good reasons that it’s considered to be one of the best and most benevolent planets to have there</p>
          <p>Why?</p>
          <p>Because it allows for effortless-easy flow of all types of energy – especially the heavy energies of money
            which bring you financial <b>abundance and wealth</b></p>
          <p>No wonder Jupiterians are usually not only lucky but also capable of making their own luck – and I’ll prove
            that to you in just a moment</p>
          <p>But before I do, we first need to look at something else</p>
          <p>Because what’s even more interesting is that Jupiter is the <u>ruling planet</u> of the <span
              id="signUser2"></span> sign – that right <span class="first_name"></span>, it rules YOUR Sun Sign.</p>
          <p>This means its influence on your life is particularly strong which indicates a lot of luck and financial
            opportunities.</p>
          <p>But I sense that…</p>
          <h1>
            <center style="color:#b42c00;font-weight: bold;padding:20px 0 20px 0">It’s not a feeling of gratitude<br>
              which brings you to my site</center>
          </h1>
          <p><u>So</u> I looked even closer into your constellations, and saw that <b>your 2nd and 11th house are
              empty!</b></p>
          <p>You may not have heard about this before but there are some rare cases when houses do not have any of the
            astral energy the planets bring…and the consequences are always <b>bad</b> because it blocks the <u>cosmic
              energy flow</u></p>
          <p>In your case it’s even worse as both of these houses are related to money!</p>
          <p>The 2nd house stands for <b>stored wealth</b> such as your savings. Because you have a blockage there it’s
            likely you struggle with credit card debts or mortgages</p>
          <p>The 11th house stands for <b>financial and social stability</b>. When you have a blockage there you don’t
            have many friends if any and you tend to live from paycheck to paycheck</p>
          <h1>
            <center style="color:#b42c00;font-weight: bold;padding:20px 0 20px 0">Does this situation sound familiar to
              you?</center>
          </h1>
          <p>You could be one of the luckiest people you can imagine…living a life full of financial <b>abundance and
              happiness…</b></p>
          <p>And yet the astral energies which lead you to this new life are <b>blocked</b> which is why you’re
            experiencing a <u>lack of money</u> instead</p>
          <p>And this is exactly why you need the urgent help your Wealth Manifestation Horoscope brings</p>
          <p>It’s the very horoscope which has already help hundreds of my clients end their financial hardship and
            unlock a life of “and” instead of “or”</p>
          <p>Here’s just a small selection of the feedback I receive from some of them every single day</p>

          <p>You may be wondering why I’m receiving <u>this many testimonials</u> from happy clients</p>
          <h1>
            <center style="color:#b42c00;font-weight: bold;padding:20px 0 20px 0">Let me be frank with you:</center>
          </h1>
          <p>The reason is not that I’ve been practicing astrological counseling for <u>over 30 years</u> now…giving
            <u>over 25,000 readings</u>
          </p>
          <p>The reason is not that I’ve worked with <u>stars</u> from the world of <u>showbusiness and international
              finance</u> who have been so astonished with the accuracy of my predictions that they swore me to secrecy
          </p>
          <p>And the reason is also not that I’ve written and published several book on various astrological topic….the
            international conferences to which I regularly get invited as a speaker…or the fact that I was awarded the
            status of <u>Senior Associate of The American Federation of Astrologers</u></p>
          <p>The <b>real reason</b> is that I really care about the results I bring for my clients…people like yourself
            who’re stuck between a rock and a hard place even though their birth constellation marks them for a life of
            abundance and wealth</p>
          <p>I honestly can’t live with this unfairness life sometimes brings and I consider my work a small
            contribution to balance things out and bring people who deserve it the life they are meant to live</p>
          <p>And today…right now…</p>
          <h1>
            <center style="color:#b42c00;font-weight: bold;padding:20px 0 20px 0">I want to make things right for you
            </center>
          </h1>
          <p>While you were away, I completed your Wealth Manifestation Horoscope because <u>I knew you would return</u>
          </p>
          <p>From looking at it I can tell you that this year brings a <b>powerful shift</b> in your life</p>
          <p>Jupiter goes retrograde in [[ $customDatetime format="MMMM" ]] and it’s time to let it do its work for you
          </p>
          <p>I told you before that as a Jupiterians you are capable of <u>making your own luck</u></p>
          <p>And now it’s decision time: Your Destiny is calling with a life of opulence you could only dream of</p>
          <p>You can pass it by…leave this site…and return to a life that you feel isn’t right for you</p>
          <p>Or you can change it all in one click by getting your <b>Wealth Manifestation Horoscope</b> by hitting the

                          information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence.</p>
                        <p><span class="info">Introduction</span> Our company collects information in different ways
                          from Visitors and Subscribers who access the various parts of our Services and the
                          network of web sites accessible through our Service.</p>
                        <p>We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and
                          security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company collects information from all
                          end users of our Internet Services (the "Services") – those who access some of our
                          Services but do not have accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who may purchase
                          Products and/or pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service ("Subscribers") –
                          what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Subscribers
                          have concerning the collection and use of such information. We request that you read
                          this Privacy Policy carefully.</p>
                        <p>Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of
                          information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we
                          collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy
                          Policy.</p>
                        <p><span class="info">Registration</span> Subscribers may be asked to provide certain
                          personal information when they sign up for our Products or Services including name,
                          address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and the
                          type of personal computer being used to access the Services. The personal information
                          collected from Subscribers during the registration process is used to manage each
                          Subscriber's account (such as for billing purposes). This information may be shared with
                          third parties, as stated herein, or in special circumstances.</p>
                        <p>However, in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote our Services, we
                          may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, and
                          username of persons who subscribed do the Services as a result of the joint promotion
                          for the purpose of offering you other products and services.</p>
                        <p>In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner for any other
                          purpose. We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal
                          information Subscribers provide during registration (such as the total number, but not
                          the names, of Subscribers). As explained in more detail below, we may use this
                          aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the
                          Services.</p>
                        <p>Also, with purchases, we supply our member's contact information, to our business
                          partners, who then may contact the member by telephone after the member purchase. Sales
                          proceeds are collected by the business partner company. We also may supply other
                          companies with contact information, for mail offers we believe would be of interest to
                          our Subscribers, with or without compensation from those companies. At times we may send
                          and advertisement for a third party product, where we collect the sales proceeds, and
                          forward the purchaser's information to that third party.</p>
                        <p><span class="info">Our Company Partners and Sponsors</span> Some products and services
                          may be offered to Visitors and Subscribers in conjunction with an affiliate, independent
                          contractor seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and Members some of
                          these products and services, the partner may need to collect and maintain personal
                          information.</p>
                        <p><span class="info">Online Shopping</span> At some web sites, you can purchase products
                          and services or register to receive materials, such as a newsletter, catalog or new
                          product and service updates. In many cases, you may be asked to provide contact
                          information, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit
                          card information.</p>
                        <p>If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent directly to
                          a recipient, you may be asked to provide information about the recipient, such as the
                          recipient's name, address, and phone number. Our company has no control over the third
                          parties' use of any personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please
                          exercise care when doing so.</p>
                        <p>If you order services or products directly from our company, we use the personal
                          information you provide to process that order. We do share this information with outside
                          parties that we do business with.</p>
                        <p><span class="info">Online Advertisements</span> Our company may display our online
                          advertisements. In those cases we share information about our Visitors and Subscribers
                          collected through the registration process as well as through online surveys and
                          promotions with these advertisers.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, in some instances, we use this information to deliver tailored
                          advertisements or joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company
                          tells us the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement tailored to
                          the audience. Based upon the information we have collected, we may then display or send
                          the advertisement to the intended audience. Our company does share personal information
                          about its Visitors or Subscribers with these advertisers or joint venture companies.</p>
                        <p><span class="info">Responses to Email Inquiries</span> When Visitors or Subscribers send
                          email inquiries to our company, the return email address is used to answer the email
                          inquiry we receive.</p>
                        <p><span class="info">Voluntary Customer Surveys</span> We may periodically conduct both
                          business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in
                          these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to
                          improve the types of products and services we offer and how we provide them to you.</p>
                        <p>We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer
                          Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other customers we may have,
                          to create broader, generic response to the survey questions (such as gender, age,
                          residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic
                          information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our
                          services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated,
                          non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties.</p>
                        <p><span class="info">Promotions</span> Our company may offer polls, contests, sweepstakes,
                          drawings, games, content, or other promotions that are sponsored by or co-branded with
                          third parties. You may be entered in a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, simply
                          by making a purchase from us or by providing us with personally identifiable information
                          for some other reason or purpose. Due to these third party relationships, the third
                          parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit
                          to our company. Our company has no control over third parties' use of this information.
                        </p>
                        <p>Additionally, personally identifiable information may be collected when you order
                          products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to
                          one of our Services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online
                          forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable information that may be
                          collected at these pages include but may not be limited to: name, address, e-mail
                          address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about
                          your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. Our sponsors or
                          third parties may send you material that relates to our company's services, products or
                          activities.</p>
